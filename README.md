# NLP Foundations Repository

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and datasets for learning NLP from scratch. It covers  :

- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleaning, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization (small examples included).  
- **Rule-Based NLP:** POS tagging, parsing, and basic rule-based methods (with simple text examples).  
- **Classical Machine Learning:** Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM for text classification (example dataset [`spam.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)).  
- **Word Embeddings:** Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText (illustrated with small example sentences).  

Each notebook provides **hands-on examples on small texts** to help understand the concepts step by step.
